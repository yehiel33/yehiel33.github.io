## Bio

Over the past decade, I have amassed valuable experience and expertise by working in four different organizations within the data center industry. Simultaneously, I pursued my Bachelor's degree in industrial engineering and management, with a specialization in information systems.

Equipped with this diverse background, I am now fully prepared to embark on my next challenge and seize new opportunities. My passion lies in the field of data, and my ultimate goal is to establish myself as a data analyst.

To showcase my projects and demonstrate my capabilities, I have created a web page that complements my GitHub portfolio. This combined platform will provide you with comprehensive insights into my skills and accomplishments.
